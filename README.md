# Global-Health-And-Economic-Indicators-
Background
This report visualizes key global health and economic indicators across 134 countries. The purpose is to offer insights into how health metrics—such as life expectancy, Body Mass Index (BMI), and mortality rates—interact with economic factors like GDP and population. The report includes various data visualizations, focusing on life expectancy, GDP, disease distribution, and mortality rates.
Data Sources
•	World Health Organization (WHO): Primary source of global health data, providing metrics on life expectancy, disease prevalence, and mortality rates.
Methodology (ETL)
•	Data Collection: Data was collected from WHO, ensuring comprehensive coverage of health-related metrics for all 145 countries included in the study.

•	Data Cleaning:
o	Removed null, missing, and outlier values to ensure data accuracy.
o	Adjusted data types to match the respective fields.
o	Removed duplicate records to avoid redundancy in analysis.

•	Load Data
Load the data to Power BI to create visuals

Visualization
The cleaned and analyzed data was visualized using Power BI, allowing interactive exploration of health and economic trends.


Visual Components
•	Countries Covered: 145
•	Life Expectancy:
o	Average: 69.26 years
o	Maximum: 89.00 years 
o	Minimum: 44.00 years
•	Filters: Users can filter the visualizations by status, country, and year for a more segmented view of the data.
Key Visualizations
1.	Life Expectancy vs. BMI (Scatter Plot).
This visualization compares the sum of life expectancy and BMI for each country, highlighting potential relationships between overall health and life expectancy.
2.	Infant Deaths, Adult Mortality, and Under-Five Deaths by Year (Line Graph).
This graph demonstrates how infant deaths, adult mortality, and under-five deaths have evolved over time, showing key trends and fluctuations.
3.	Polio, Measles, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B (Tree Map).
The Map shows the proportion of under-five deaths attributable to these diseases, giving a visual sense of their relative impact compared to other causes.
4.	GDP and Life Expectancy by Country (Scatter Plot)
5.	 This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the sum of GDP and life expectancy for each country, indicating the potential correlation between economic prosperity and health.
6.	Country Table (Selected Countries).
A detailed table includes key metrics for countries covering avg population, GDP, total expenditure on health, and life expectancy.
Insights
•	Countries with higher GDP generally tend to have higher life expectancies, although there are notable exceptions.
•	Mortality rates for infants and adults have fluctuated over time, with significant reductions around the year 2015.
•	Diseases such as measles are largely vaccinated against hence contributing least to mortality rate



Conclusion
This report provides a detailed view of the relationship between global health and economic indicators. The interactive visualizations and filters allow users to explore these metrics in depth, gaining valuable insights into global health trends. These insights can support decision-making related to public health, economic development, and policy formulation.
